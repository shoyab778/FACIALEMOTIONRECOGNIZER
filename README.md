# Facial_Emotion_Recognizer_Model
Real-Time Emotion Detection System

A deep learning-based real-time emotion detection system using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.

🚀 Features
- Real-time facial emotion recognition.
- Face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascade.
- Live webcam support with efficient predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy.

🔧 Installation & Usage
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras
python realtimedetection.py
```
Press 'q' to exit the webcam feed.

📚 Training & Testing
- Preprocess dataset, build CNN model, train & validate.
- Model saved as `facialemotionmodel.h5`.

📂 Code Structure
- `realtimedetection.py` – Emotion detection script.
- `trainmodel.ipynb` – Model training notebook.
- `facialemotionmodel.h5` – Pre-trained model.

⚠️ Error Handling
- Handles model loading, webcam issues, and face detection failures.

🔮 Future Improvements
